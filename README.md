## Introduction

This is not ready yet because no body will be ready it. Usally it is used to have a well format document.

## Metrics

The following metrics are designed to be a reference for the final user or tools programmers that need to make an analysis of the network to establish the quality of one node.

E.g: Tools like [cliboss](https://github.com/ZmnSCPxj/clboss) for c-lightning can work wery well is it has additional details about the reliability of one node.
